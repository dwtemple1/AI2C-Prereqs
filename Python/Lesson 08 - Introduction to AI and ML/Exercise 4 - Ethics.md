# Exercise 4: The "Smart Toy" Ethics Check

## Topic: AI Ethics

Scenario: A company launches a "Smart Teddy Bear" that uses AI to learn a child's name and converse with them. It records conversations to "improve the model."

Task: Using the ethical risks mentioned in the presentation, identify one potential issue for each category:

Privacy: What happens to the recordings of the child? Who owns that data? 

Bias: If the bear was trained mostly on voices of children from one specific region, what happens when a child with a different accent speaks to it? 

Security/Safety: What if a stranger could hack into the bear via Bluetooth?
