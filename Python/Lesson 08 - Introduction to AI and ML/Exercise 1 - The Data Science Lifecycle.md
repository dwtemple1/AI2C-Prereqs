# Exercise 1: The Data Science Lifecycle (Conceptual)

## Topic: Applying the Data Science Lifecycle  

Scenario: You want to build a system that predicts how long your morning commute to work/school will take based on the weather and time of departure.

Task: Map this problem to the lifecycle steps found in the slides:

Problem Definition: What is the specific question you are trying to answer?

Data Collection: What specific data points would you need to collect every day? (e.g., departure time, rain (yes/no), temperature).

Data Cleaning: What might be "bad data" in this scenario? (e.g., you forgot to record the time one day).

Feature Engineering: What is a new feature you could create from existing data? (e.g., "Is it a holiday?" or "Day of the week").

Model Building: Would this be a Classification (Late vs. On Time) or Regression (Minutes) problem?
