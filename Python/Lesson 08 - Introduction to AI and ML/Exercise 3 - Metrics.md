# Exercise 3: The "Metric Match"

## Topic: Model Performance Metrics

Scenario: You are choosing the best metric for different AI models. Task: Match the scenario to the best metric: Recall or Precision.

Scenario A (Cancer Diagnosis): It is critical that you catch every actual case of cancer. It is okay if you accidentally flag a healthy person (false positive), but missing a sick person is dangerous.

Scenario B (YouTube Recommendations for Kids): You want to ensure that only safe videos are shown. It is okay if you miss some safe videos, but you absolutely cannot show an unsafe one.


(Hint: Scenario A requires high Recall; Scenario B requires high Precision.)
